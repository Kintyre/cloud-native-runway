## General info

These documents are written in [reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html).

## Requirements

Take a look at the [readthedocs getting started guide](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html).

## Deployment

To make quick changes, just commit your edits and push to `master`. Once the automated build process completes, you'll be able to see your changes in the Runway's [readthedocs site](https://kintyre-runway-docs.readthedocs.io/).

If you've installed the [required Python libraries](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html), you can `make html` and generate the docs locally.

## Context

To make your reStructuredText composition a little easier:

* Edit on the web: [Rsted](http://rst.ninjs.org/)

* Edit locally: Grab the reStructuredText [VS Code extension](https://docs.restructuredtext.net/)
